## 🔐 Security & Access

### Firestore Security Rules (Already Applied)
Your current security rules should look like this:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    
    function isAdmin() {
      return request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == 'aoSHGmN7TyOs4eLzJUwSRK2';
    }
    
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if isAdmin() && userId == 'aoSHGmN7TyOs4eLzJUwSRK2';
    }
    
    match /quotes/{quoteId} {
      allow read, write: if isAdmin();
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** You can verify these rules in Firebase Console → Firestore → Rules tab
